## Openings Principals

1. Control the center: Aim to influence the central squares (e4, d4, e5, d5) with pawns or pieces.
2. Develop minor pieces quickly: Bring out knights and bishops early, usually before moving the same piece twice.
3. Develop with a purpose: Each move should contribute to development, central control, or king safety.
4. Castle early: Get your king to safety and connect your rooks as soon as reasonable.
5. Do not bring the queen out too early: Early queen moves can invite tempo-gaining attacks from minor pieces.
6. Avoid moving the same piece repeatedly in the opening: Unless forced or tactically justified, prioritize developing new pieces.
7. Do not make unnecessary pawn moves: Pawn moves create permanent weaknesses; every pawn move should have a clear goal.
8. Connect the rooks: Clear the back rank so rooks can support the center and open files.
9. Maintain piece coordination: Pieces should support each other and work toward common plans.
10. Avoid early material grabs: Winning a pawn can be less important than completing development.
11. Develop pieces to active squares: Choose squares that give mobility, pressure, or tactical potential—not just “safe” squares.
12. Complete development before launching attacks: Premature attacks often fail against solid, well-developed positions.
13. Respect opening theory, but understand ideas: Memorization matters less than understanding plans and typical structures.
14. Pay attention to king safety at all times: Even after castling, avoid weakening the king’s pawn shield.
15. Be ready to transition to the middle game: Once development is complete, shift focus to plans, pawn breaks, and piece activity.
